class ActQuant(QuantCell):
    r"""
    Quantization aware training activation function.

    Add the fake quantized operation to the end of activation operation, by which the output of activation
    operation will be truncated. For more details about Quantization, please refer to the implementation
    of subclass of `FakeQuantWithMinMaxObserver`, :class:`mindspore.nn.FakeQuantWithMinMaxObserver`.

    Args:
        activation (Cell): Activation cell.

    Inputs:
        - **x** (Tensor) - The input of ActQuant. The input dimension is preferably 2D or 4D.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, with the same type and shape as the `x`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `activation` is not an instance of Cell.
        TypeError: If `fake_before` is not a bool.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> act_quant = nn.ActQuant(nn.ReLU())
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, -1], [-2, 0, -1]]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> result = act_quant(x)
