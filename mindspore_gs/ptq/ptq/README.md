# Applying the PTQ Algorithm

## Introduction to the PTQ Algorithm

### Original Purpose

In order to realize the combined quantization algorithm, as well as subsequent support for complex quantization algorithms such as mixed-precision quantization and automatic optimization search, MindSpore introduces a post-training quantization algorithm called PTQ. This algorithm relies on MindSpore's front-end parallelism to realize more complex algorithm implementation logic.

The algorithm is able to provide the capability of both RoundToNearest and SmoothQuant quantization algorithms, and subsequent new post-training quantization algorithms will evolve on this algorithm, so we named the algorithm PTQ.

### Design Ideas

![architecture diagram](images/en/arch.png)

Layered implementation of quantization algorithms, mainly divided into config, quantization algorithm, algorithm module, quantized Cell, quantization tool function.

- config is mainly used for user configuration algorithms, and implements yaml serialization deserialization capabilities.
- The quantization algorithm is the main entrance of the algorithm, the PTQ algorithm is also inherited from the Golden Stick algorithm base class CompAlgo, which implements the apply and convert interfaces to realize the quantization checkpoint and the quantization deployment network export functions respectively.
- Algorithm modules are some modularized functional blocks. For example, the Smooth module for the Linear layer and the Quantization module for the Linear and KVCache layers are built into this PTQ algorithm. By assembling these modules, various algorithms can be implemented, such as the SmoothQuant algorithm. This ensures that the PTQ algorithm is highly scalable and flexible.
- Quantized Cell is a quantized network layer obtained by encapsulation for a specific non-quantized network layer, which is used to realize the quantization of a specific network layer. The quantized network layer is introduced by registration, which realizes the decoupling between different network frameworks, such as the decoupling of Golden Stick and MindFormers.
- Quantization tool functions are some basic tool functions, such as the calculation of quantization parameters, quantization of matrices and so on.

### Support Range

Table 1: PTQ algorithm specifications

| Specifications | Specification Descriptions |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware Support | Atlas 800I A2 |
| Network Support | ParallelLlamaForCausalLM. For details, refer to [ParallelLlamaForCausalLM Network](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindformers/blob/dev/mindformers/experimental/infer/models/llama/llama.py). |
| Operation Mode Support | The quantization checkpoint phase supports only PyNative mode, and the quantization inference phase is not limited to modes, suggesting GraphMode for better performance. |

> The current PTQ algorithm relies on the complete DecoderLayer to do the network topology analysis, so it does not support any network constructed based on the Linear layer of MindFormers. We plan to improve this in the subsequent version to enhance the network generalization ability of the PTQ algorithm.

## Samples

Like all algorithms of the Golden Stick, the application of the PTQ algorithm can be divided into two main phases: the quantization phase and the deployment phase.

The quantization phase is done in advance before deployment and the main tasks are: collecting the distribution of weights, calculating the quantization parameters, quantizing the weight data, and inserting the anti-quantization nodes.

The deployment phase is typically the process of inference about the quantized model in a production environment, using the MindSpore framework.

This use case is demonstrated using the ParallelLlamaForCausalLM 7B network in four main steps: environment preparation, model quantification, model deployment evaluation, and effect analysis.

### Step 1. Environment Preparation

#### 1.1. Ascend Environment

The PTQ algorithm needs to run on Ascend hardware, and the environment configuration of Ascend can be found in the Installing Ascend AI processor software package and Configuring Environment Variables subsection in [MindSpore Installation Guide](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/en).

#### 1.2. MindSpore Environment

Golden Stick relies on MindSpore, and you need to install the proper MindSpore in advance. You can download the pre-compiled [v2.4.0 installation package](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions/en) from the MindSpore official website and install it.

#### 1.3. MindFormers Environment

This sample quantizes and reasons about networks in MindFormers, so you need to install the appropriate MindFormers in advance. You can download the pre-compiled [v1.3.0 installation package](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions/en) from the MindSpore official website and install it.

#### 1.4. Golden Stick Environment

Download the pre-compiled [MindSpore GoldenStick v0.6.0 installation package](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions) from the MindSpore website and install it.

#### 1.5. Preparation of Relevant Documents

You need to download [squad1.1 dataset](https://data.deepai.org/squad1.1.zip), [Llama2 7B pre-training weights](https://ascend-repo-modelzoo.obs.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/MindFormers/llama2/llama2_7b.ckpt)和[Llama2 tokenizer file](https://ascend-repo-modelzoo.obs.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/MindFormers/llama2/tokenizer.model) in advance.

**Step 1** Create a working directory:

```shell
mkdir workspace
```

**Step 2** Prepare the dataset, you need to download the squad dataset manually due to permissions restrictions:

Dataset download address: [squad1.1 dataset](https://data.deepai.org/squad1.1.zip)

Once the download is complete, copy the resulting dataset squad1.1.zip to the workspace directory created in the first step and make sure that the dataset name is squad1.1.zip, then run the decompression code:

```shell
cd workspace
unzip squad1.1.zip -d ./squad
```

After decompressing the squad1.1.zip file using the unzip command, the train-v1.1.json and dev-v1.1.json quantization dataset files can be obtained, and we first use the train dataset for the quantization calibration, and then use the dev dataset for the quantization evaluation.

**Step 3** Prepare the checkpoint file for the Llama2 7b network, the Llama2 tokenizer file, and the Llama2 model configuration file:

Download address:

[Llama2 7b checkpoint](https://ascend-repo-modelzoo.obs.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/MindFormers/llama2/llama2_7b.ckpt)

[Llama2 tokenizer file](https://ascend-repo-modelzoo.obs.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/MindFormers/llama2/tokenizer.model)

[llama2 model configuration file](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindformers/blob/dev/configs/llama2/predict_llama2_7b.yaml)

After downloading the above 3 files, copy them to the workspace directory.

After preparing the above files, the directory structure is:

```shell
workspace
  ├── squad
  ├     ├── train-v1.1.json
  ├     └── dev-v1.1.json
  ├── predict_llama2_7b.yaml
  ├── tokenizer.model
  └── llama2_7b.ckpt
```

### Step 2. Model Quantization

#### 2.1. Constructing Non-quantized Networks

Constructing the ParallelLlamaForCausalLM 7B network for the MindFormers bin first requires the following changes to the predict_llama2_7b.yaml file:

1. Update the load_checkpoint field to the path where llama2_7b.ckpt is located.

2. Update the vocab_file field in process to the path where tokenizer.model is located. Add this field manually if it does not exist.

3. Modify device_id in context to be the idle device id of the current machine and mode in context to be 1, i.e. PYNATIVE mode.

4. Modify the model.arch.type field to ParallelLlamaForCausalLM.

5. Modify use_parallel to True, parallel.parallel_mode to 'STAND_ALONE', and parallel_config.data_parallel to 1, and parallel.full_batch to False.

Note that the ParallelLlamaForCausalLM 7B network from MindFormers must use msrun to run even on a single card. the use of msrun can refer to [msrun instructions](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.4.0/model_train/parallel/msrun_launcher.html), here is an example:

```bash
msrun --worker_num=1 --local_worker_num=1 --master_port=12345 --log_dir=msrun_log --join=True --cluster_time_out=300 python sample.py
```

the complete sample code can be found in [quant_ckpt.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/golden-stick/blob/r0.6.0/example/ptq/quant_ckpt.py).

Once the modifications are complete, you can use the MFParallelLlama2Helper provided by Golden Stick to easily construct the network and load the checkpoint through the configuration file with the following code:

```python
from mindspore_gs.ptq.network_helpers.mf_net_helpers import MFParallelLlama2Helper

config_path = '/path/to/workspace/predict_llama2_7b.yaml'
helper = MFParallelLlama2Helper(config_path)
network = helper.create_network()
```

#### 2.2. Constructing the squad-v1.1 Dataset loader

We constructs the squad-v1.1 dataset loader using the get_datasets interface of mindspore_gs based the calibration of the quantization process on squad's train-v1.1.json.

Generally the quantization calibration phase will only use hundreds of pieces of data for calibration, in the current sample we use the n_samples parameter to specify that only 200 data from the dataset should be loaded. The code is as follows:

```python
from mindspore_gs.datasets import get_datasets

ds_path = '/path/to/workspace/squad/train-v1.1.json'
bs_ = helper.get_spec('batch_size')
seq_ = helper.get_spec('seq_length')
max_decode_length = helper.get_spec('max_decode_length')
ignore_token_id = helper.get_spec('ignore_token_id')
tokenizer = helper.create_tokenizer()
ds = get_datasets('squad1.1', ds_path, "train", bs_, seq_, max_decode_length, tokenizer, ignore_token_id, 1,
                  False, n_samples=200)
```

#### 2.3. Constructing Quantization Algorithms

The PTQ algorithm supports the a16w8 weight quantization and c8 (kvcache int8) algorithms implemented by the basic round to nearest method, as well as the a8w8 algorithm implemented by the smooth-quant method, and also supports the a16w8 weight quantization algorithm and the c8 algorithm combined quantization algorithm, the smooth-quant and c8 combined quantization algorithm.

We can enable different quantization capabilities according to the PTQConfig configuration. The meaning of PTQConfig can refer to its [API documentation](https://www.mindspore.cn/golden_stick/docs/en/master/ptq/mindspore_gs.ptq.PTQConfig.html#mindspore_gs.ptq.PTQConfig), and here we show sample configurations for these algorithms:

- a16w8 weight quantization

    ```python
    from mindspore import dtype as msdtype
    from mindspore_gs.ptq import PTQConfig, OutliersSuppressionType

    ptq_config = PTQConfig(weight_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8,  act_quant_dtype=None,  kvcache_quant_dtype=None,
                        outliers_suppression=OutliersSuppressionType.NONE)
    ```

- smooth-quant quantization

    ```python
    from mindspore import dtype as msdtype
    from mindspore_gs.ptq import PTQConfig, OutliersSuppressionType

    ptq_config = PTQConfig(weight_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, act_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, kvcache_quant_dtype=None,
                        outliers_suppression=OutliersSuppressionType.SMOOTH)
    ```

- kvcache int8 quantization

    ```python
    from mindspore import dtype as msdtype
    from mindspore_gs.ptq import PTQConfig, OutliersSuppressionType

    ptq_config = PTQConfig(weight_quant_dtype=None, act_quant_dtype=None, kvcache_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8,
                        outliers_suppression=OutliersSuppressionType.NONE)
    ```

- a16w8 weight quantization combined kvcache int8 quantization

    ```python
    from mindspore import dtype as msdtype
    from mindspore_gs.ptq import PTQConfig, OutliersSuppressionType

    ptq_config = PTQConfig(weight_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, act_quant_dtype=None, kvcache_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8,
                        outliers_suppression=OutliersSuppressionType.NONE)
    ```

- smooth-quant weight quantization combined kvcache int8 quantization

    ```python
    from mindspore import dtype as msdtype
    from mindspore_gs.ptq import PTQConfig, OutliersSuppressionType

    ptq_config = PTQConfig(weight_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, act_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, kvcache_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8,
                        outliers_suppression=OutliersSuppressionType.SMOOTH)
    ```

Once you have the PTQConfig, the next step is to construct the PTQ algorithm with the following code:

> For ParallelLlamaForCausalLM networks, certain layers are more sensitive to quantization and are not suitable for quantization, and we usually help to skip quantization of these layers by means of the opname_blacklist field.

```python
from mindspore_gs.ptq.ptq import PTQ
from mindspore_gs.common import BackendTarget
from mindspore_gs.ptq import PTQMode, PTQConfig, OutliersSuppressionType

ptq_config = PTQConfig(mode=PTQMode.QUANTIZE, backend=BackendTarget.ASCEND, opname_blacklist=["w2", "lm_head"],
                       weight_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, act_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8, kvcache_quant_dtype=msdtype.int8)
ptq = PTQ(config=ptq_config)
```

#### 2.4. Quantizing the Network and Saving the Quantization checkpoint File

Next, quantization correction is performed on the network, which is divided into two main steps: **the first step** is to use PTQ's apply interface to quantize the network; **the second step** is to use PTQ's convert interface to transform the quantization-corrected network into a real quantized network corresponding to the backend:

```python
import mindspore as ms

ptq.apply(network, helper, ds)
ptq.convert(network)
ms.save_checkpoint(network.parameters_dict(), "a8w8c8.ckpt",
                   choice_func=lambda x: "key_cache" not in x and "value_cache" not in x and "float_weight" not in x)
print("quant checkpoint saved at 'a8w8c8.ckpt'", flush=True)
```

After a successful run, the quantized checkpoint file is saved under the `/path/to/workspace/a8w8c8.ckpt` path.

### Step 3. Model Deployment

#### 3.1. Evaluating F1EM Metrics for FP16 Networks

Evaluation of F1EM metrics for the ParallelLlamaForCausalLM-7B network using the squad1.1 dev dataset. A full sample can be found in [eval_squad.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/golden-stick/blob/r0.6.0/example/ptq/eval_squad.py). Note that msrun is required to run it, and the usage of msrun can be found in [msrun usage instructions](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.4.0/model_train/parallel/msrun_launcher.html).

> Before the review, please make sure that the load_checkpoint field in the yaml configuration file is properly configured with the non-quantized network checkpoint file path:`/path/to/workspace/llama2_7b.ckpt`. And configure context.mode to 0, which is the static graph mode.

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore as ms
from mindformers.core.metric import EmF1Metric
from mindspore_gs.ptq.network_helpers.mf_net_helpers import MFParallelLlama2Helper
from mindspore_gs.datasets import get_datasets
from mindspore_gs.common import logger

config_path = '/path/to/workspace/predict_llama2_7b.yaml'
helper = MFParallelLlama2Helper(config_path)
network = helper.create_network()

ds_path = '/path/to/workspace/squad/dev-v1.1.json'
bs_ = helper.get_spec('batch_size')
seq_ = helper.get_spec('seq_length')
max_decode_length = helper.get_spec('max_decode_length')
ignore_token_id = helper.get_spec('ignore_token_id')
top_k = helper.get_spec("top_k")
top_p = helper.get_spec("top_p")
do_sample = helper.get_spec("do_sample")
pad_token_id = helper.get_spec("pad_token_id")
tokenizer = helper.create_tokenizer()
ds = get_datasets('squad1.1', ds_path, "eval", bs_, seq_, max_decode_length, tokenizer, ignore_token_id, 1,
                  False, n_samples=1000)

metric = EmF1Metric()
metric.clear()

data_count = 0
total_count = ds.get_dataset_size()
for _, ds_item in enumerate(ds.create_dict_iterator()):
    data_count += 1
    logger.info(f"Dataset count: {data_count}/{total_count}")
    input_ids = ds_item['input_ids'].asnumpy()
    labels = ds_item['labels'].asnumpy()

    valid_length_each_example = []
    for j in range(input_ids.shape[0]):
        # As the nonzero returns the index and we need length
        valid_length_each_example.append(np.max(np.argwhere(input_ids[j] != pad_token_id)) + 1)
    valid_length_each_example = np.array(valid_length_each_example)

    outputs = network.generate(input_ids, do_sample=do_sample, max_length=seq_, top_p=top_p, top_k=top_k, max_new_tokens=200)
    output_ids = []
    for j in range(input_ids.shape[0]):
        output_ids.append(outputs[j][int(valid_length_each_example[j]):])

    pres_str = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
    labels_str = tokenizer.decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)
    metric.update(pres_str, labels_str)
metric.eval()
```

#### 3.2. Evaluation of F1EM Metrics for Quantized Networks

Since MindSpore does not currently support saving modified networks, an algorithm is needed to recover the network with quantized structures before loading the checkpoint to the network before loading the quantized ckpt.

The evaluation script logic is consistent with that of the non-quantized network, although a step is added in the middle to modify the network to a quantized network.

> Please make sure that the load_checkpoint field in the yaml configuration file is configured with the correct path to the quantized network checkpoint file: `/path/to/workspace/a8w8c8.ckpt` before evaluating.

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore as ms
from mindspore.communication.management import init
from mindformers.core.metric import EmF1Metric
from mindformers import MindFormerConfig, AutoModel
from mindspore_gs.ptq.network_helpers.mf_net_helpers import MFParallelLlama2Helper

config_path = '/path/to/workspace/predict_llama2_7b.yaml'
mf_config = MindFormerConfig(config_path)

ms.set_context(mode=mf_config.context.mode, device_target=mf_config.context.device_target,
                jit_config={"jit_level": "O0", "infer_boost": "on"})
init()
network = AutoModel.from_config(mf_config, download_checkpoint=False)
network.set_train(False)
network.phase = 'predict'

ptq_config = PTQConfig(mode=PTQMode.DEPLOY, backend=BackendTarget.ASCEND, opname_blacklist=["w2", "lm_head"],
                       weight_quant_dtype=ms.dtype.int8, act_quant_dtype=ms.dtype.int8, kvcache_quant_dtype=ms.dtype.int8)
ptq = PTQ(config=ptq_config)
ptq.apply(network)
ptq.convert(network)

ms.load_checkpoint(mf_config.load_checkpoint, network)

helper = MFParallelLlama2Helper(mf_config)
ds_path = '/path/to/squad/dev-v1.1.json'
bs_ = helper.get_spec('batch_size')

tokenizer = helper.create_tokenizer()
ds = get_datasets('squad1.1', ds_path, "eval", bs_, seq_, max_decode_length, tokenizer, ignore_token_id, 1,
                  False, n_samples=1000)

metric = EmF1Metric()
metric.clear()

data_count = 0
total_count = ds.get_dataset_size()
for _, ds_item in enumerate(ds.create_dict_iterator()):
    data_count += 1
    logger.info(f"Dataset count: {data_count}/{total_count}")
    input_ids = ds_item['input_ids'].asnumpy()
    labels = ds_item['labels'].asnumpy()

    valid_length_each_example = []
    for j in range(input_ids.shape[0]):
        # As the nonzero returns the index and we need length
        valid_length_each_example.append(np.max(np.argwhere(input_ids[j] != pad_token_id)) + 1)
    valid_length_each_example = np.array(valid_length_each_example)

    outputs = network.generate(input_ids, do_sample=do_sample, max_length=seq_, top_p=top_p, top_k=top_k, max_new_tokens=200)
    output_ids = []
    for j in range(input_ids.shape[0]):
        output_ids.append(outputs[j][int(valid_length_each_example[j]):])

    pres_str = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
    labels_str = tokenizer.decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)
    metric.update(pres_str, labels_str)
metric.eval()
```

### Step 4. Effect Analysis

Table 2: ParallelLlamaForCausalLM-7B network before and after A8W8C8 quantization using PTQ algorithm

| Metrics | FP16 | PTQ-A8W8C8 | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ckpt-size(GB)↓ | 13 | 7.9 | 39.2% |
| F1↓ | 33% | 32% | -1% |
| EM↓ | 0 | 0 | - |

It can be seen that after A8W8C8 quantization by the PTQ algorithm:

1. The number of parameters in the quantized network shrinks by 39.2%, i.e., the network is deployed with the static memory footprint dropping to 60.8% of what it was at Float16. The quantized network can thus be deployed on more resource-constrained environments or provide greater throughput in the same environment.
2. The F1 of the quantized network on the squad1.1 dataset decreased by 1%, i.e., the quantized network was slightly less effective on the discriminative task on the squad1.1 dataset.
